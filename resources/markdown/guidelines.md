1.7 The online classes have a simple frequency (02 times per week), regular (03 times per week), and intensive (04 times per week).

1.15 The institution is not committed to making up a session canceled by the student. However, if the institution is responsible for the cancellation, it will make arrangements for the session to be retaken.


### 2. About the structure of online classes

2.1 The modules of the institution's language programs are based on the standards of the European Framework of Reference, starting at level A and reaching level C.

2.2 Each module is divided into 04 units that contain an electronic book, discussion forums, support material, audios, and other multimedia resources for learners to have a better experience.

2.3 Each unit develops linguistic and communicational competencies in the learners, using real and everyday communicative functions to teach the language to be learned.

2.4 The duration of each module will depend on the progress of the learner. Lingowow considers that each learning process is particular and the student must advance at his/her own pace.

2.5 The learners must complete the different assignments, practices, and exercises to acquire these competencies which will be evaluated throughout the module.


### 3. About online classes evaluation

3.1 The students are exposed to different activities, related to the development of language skills, which allows the teachers and the institution to carry out a continuous evaluation of their process.

3.2 A record of the students' progress, weaknesses, and strengths is kept for each session and objective feedback is provided to each learner.

3.3 The evaluation system is divided into three main aspects; RAE, quizzes, and final exams.

3.4 RAE is a term that encompasses the level of commitment, participation among other responsibilities and personal traits that an apprentice needs to develop to consolidate his/her learning process. It is equivalent to 15% of the final grade of the module.

3.5 Quizzes are carried out every two units to evaluate the language skills obtained in them. They consist of a written part and an oral part. Two quizzes are done per module, each quiz is equivalent to 25% of the final grade.

3.6 The first quiz must be passed for the learner to be able to access the following units of the module.

3.7 The final exam evaluates the competencies acquired during the whole module. It has a written part and an oral part and is equivalent to 35% of the final mark.

3.8 All evaluations are within the platform in the company of the apprentice's teacher.

3.9 The apprentice who fails an evaluation must repeat it before continuing with the course.

3.10 Any other activity, practice, or exercise that is considered necessary for the progress of the apprentice will be put into practice by his/her teacher or the institution and will fall within the RAE evaluation item.


### 4. About asynchronous courses (Self-paced courses)

4.1 Asynchronous courses, unlike online classes, are delivered through pre-recorded lessons (not live sessions).

4.2 Asynchronous courses are special courses where the student advances at his/her own pace, having at his/her disposal a series of materials that support his/her learning process.

4.3 A virtual book, forums, practical activities, and a 20-minute session are available to the student to clarify doubts or answer any questions, before each quiz and final exam.

4.4 The student will be able to use the forum, to make any comment or question about the material or the tools at his/her disposal.

4.5 The duration of the asynchronous courses is determined by the trainee; however, after 60 days of no activity on his account, he will be contacted by the institution.

4.6 Asynchronous courses are designed to develop specific competencies of the language skills and subskills.


### 5. About the structure of asynchronous courses

5.1 Asynchronous courses are divided into modules; depending on the course, the number of modules will increase or decrease. Each module is divided into 04 units.


### 6. About the evaluation of the asynchronous courses

6.1 Students in asynchronous courses are evaluated through quizzes, every two units, and an exam at the end of each module.

6.2 The student must pass his quizzes to access the rest of the units of the module, and must pass the final exam to access the next module.


### 7. About the suspension of the online classes

7.1 To suspend the online class service, the student must notify the school at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the new academic period.

7.2 The user of the platform will be suspended from the moment the student requests suspension of the online class service.

7.4 If the student is absent for two academic periods (eight weeks), he/she will have to take the placement test to continue his/her studies at the level he/she was at before leaving.
